# CIS 5660 HW03 Procedural Buildings

## Project Description 

I tried to base this building on Venice waterfront buildings (which I modeled the doors, windows, and balconies based on). This was my second time using Houdini, so I was not the most successful, but it is a building! Unfortunately, I also had trouble getting my balcony to stretch properly when the length was increased. I asked some TAs and got some great advice, but sadly, I was not able to figure it out in time. I think there is an issue with a transform node, though.  

In addition to the parameters in the video for the floors/floor sizes and pillars, there are parameters for: 

window length, height, and pane number 

door length, height, scale, and double door 

balcony length, width, scale, and bar number 

building color (changing the RGB values) 

## Video 

## Project Overview
In this homework you’ll gain more experience with tool creation and loops. The core of this homework will be following a Procedural House tutorial to create a multi-floor building generator. The tutorial is linked here:

## Extra Credit 

I rendered it with the Manta renderer!
